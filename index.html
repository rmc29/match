<b>Instructions</b>
<br>
This is an implementation of the card game Set.
<br>
Select groups of three cards.<br><br>
Cards have four properties:
<ul><li> shape (square, oval or zigzag), </li>
<li>colour (red, green or blue),</li>
<li> shading (empty, shaded or full), and </li>
<li>number of shapes (1, 2 or 3). </li></ul>

You score three points if you select a group of cards which, for each property, are either all the same or all different.
<br><br>
You lose one point if you select a group of cards which do not fulfil this.<BR><BR>
Equivalently: <br>
There must be no property which two of your cards share and the third does not.
<BR><BR>
When you select a correct group, the cards are removed and replaced.
